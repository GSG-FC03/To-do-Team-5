# User Experience‏
* The app is built in a way that it is easy for the user to interact with.
* Once the user opens the website/app, he will be greeted with a landing page that has the name of the website/app and short descripton of it, also there is a button which has the label of <b>"let's start !"</b>, and it takes the user to the next page.
* The next page is the dynamic, vital page, which the user will treat with, so it has the feature of <b>Add Task</b> button.
* When he press at the button, it will open form which has 5 simple elements: <b>title, time, date, description and note.</b>
* After filling the data, he has two choices to take: <b>Cancle, or Done:</b> <br> <hr>
<b>Cancel</b>: is used to ignore all of the data that have been entred.<br>
<b>Done</b>: is used to save data, list the task at the pervious page. <hr>
* After all of those processes, the tasks that have been entered and saved by the user will be shown at the dynamical page.
